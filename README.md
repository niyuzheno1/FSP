## Introduction: The Importance of Serializing Data Types for a Variety of Reasons

keywords: serialize data types, convert data types, how to convert data type

Serializing is the process of storing data in a sequence or list. It is a way to store data that can be accessed quickly and easily.

If you do not serialize, then the data will occupy space both in memory and disk. This can lead to performance degradation, increased load times and even crashes. In addition, this will also lead to fragmentation on disk which will make it difficult for the operating system to allocate more space for other files.

The main purpose of serialization is to ensure consistency between operation and idempotent. It can be used in the following cases:

-To save the state of an object for later use

-To store the state of an object for future use

-To send data over a network connection

-It can be used to convert any type of data into a byte stream that can be stored, transmitted, or converted back into its original form.

## Serializing a Type that is Unsupported by an API

keywords: unsupported type serialization, serialize unsupported type

Serializing unsupported data types is a common problem in programming. There could be cases where we are serializing a data/class that's unsupported.

This article will show how to handle serialization of unsupported data types by using our C++ Serializable interface and also discuss when not to use this interface.

Idempotency is a property of a function that says that the function can be applied multiple times without changing the result. Idempotency is a property of a function that says that the function can be applied multiple times without changing the result. This property has many applications in computer programming, especially in distributed systems. It is also important for ensuring data type serializability.

A classic example is a data structure whose state is not idempotent, such as a file/network traffic. This is an example of a non-idempotent data structure. Non-idempotent data structures are those that are not always the same when they are being read twice or more times with the same set of inputs.

Other in memory data types like string, rope, set, map can be serialized. We'll see the case in the next section.

## The art of Converting Pointer into Hexadecimal and Vice Versa

Assume that we are given data with the following instances.

A{ pointer1 : B }; B {pointer1 : A }

In the case of having circular pointer pointing, it’s hard to untangle them once they are saved into the file. However, patterns like these are ubiquitously found in the data. Examples include Treap or some kind of balance trees which needs to store parent pointers to make sure they are trackable through parent pointers. And they have child pointer which stores information about the children of a tree.

We can untangle situation like this by simply using an observer pattern.

Assume our file has the following content A B B A When we first read A, we will store the local pointer into a map so we will know whenever we see an A again in any future pointer, we can refer back to A. And then we store address B into the pointer1 field of A. Once the next item is processed, it will tell us that the new instance B is available so we will replace the old pointer of B with the new instance B’s address. And we also find an A which is in a hashmap. So we will replace it with appropriate address.

If we can serialize a pointer and a string (which is easy to serialize), then we can serialize a lot of other things as well like rope/set/map, etc by not only preserving the relationship between instances but also preserving data.
